# Liquefaction Paper

This repo includes the followings:

1 - A couple of recent papers on predicting liquefaction. 

2 - A total of four data sets. Data sets 1,2,3 are distinct data sets having only three different unique features from each others namely: N1_60 (SPT), qc1N (CPT) and Vs (SVW) respectively. Data set 4 is just a combination of them with the column "test_value" being rbind() of N1_60 , qc1N , Vs vectors and column "type" specifying the group of the "test_value" from SPT, CPT or SVW. 

3 - Models for predicting liquefaction status.
